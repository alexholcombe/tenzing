### `papaja` YAML

<!-- * * * -->

`papaja` is an R package that provides document formats to produce complete APA manuscripts from R Markdown in PDF- and DOCX-format.
The package also provides helper functions that facilitate reporting statistics, tables, and plots. [Find out more about `papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja).

You can copy the YAML code below and paste it into the YAML front matter of a `papaja`-R Markdown file to populate the author metadata.
`papaja` will automatically add the contributorship information to the author note.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("knitr")
```

~~~yaml
```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(author_yaml())
```
