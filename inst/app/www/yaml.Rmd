### `papaja` YAML

`papaja` is an R package that provides document formats to produce complete APA manuscripts from R Markdown in PDF- and DOCX-format.
The package also provides helper functions that facilitate reporting statistics, tables, and plots.

The YAML code below can be copied and pasted into the YAML front matter of a `papaja`-R Markdown file to populate the author metadata.
`papaja` will automatically add the contributorship information to the author note.

```
